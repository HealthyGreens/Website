                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to an article posted on the US National Library of Medicine, 
                    a study was conducted to see how young adult men around the mean age of 24 would react to two different activities. 
                    The first activity was that the men worked on a task on a computer while the second task was to transplant an indoor house plant. 
                    The data showed that while transplanting the houseplant, the subjects felt more “comfortable, soothed, and natural” than after completing the computer task. 
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion to the test stated that “active interaction with indoor houseplants can reduce physiological and psychological stress compared with mental work.” 
                    This study reinforces our motto here at Healthy Greens,
                     “The Grass is Always Greener on Your Side” and that Healthy Greens truly do make for a Healthy Mind.
